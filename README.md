Ex2 - Foundation of Object-Oriented Programming and Recursion

This project implements a basic spreadsheet that supports cells containing text, numbers, or formulas.
 Formulas can reference other cells and perform arithmetic operations, while also supporting nested formulas.
 The system handles errors such as invalid formulas and cyclic references (e.g., self-referencing cells).
 It calculates the computational depth of cells and evaluates formulas recursively.
 The project demonstrates object-oriented design, recursion, and error handling in Java. Unit tests are included to ensure correct functionality.
